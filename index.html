        <p> 
            Hello eager learners, my name is <em>Colin Lauret</em> and I am the designer of <strong>Learn2Code</strong>. 
            I am sure you are all very excited to get started with learning and jump right into creating advanced programs and applications.
            When beginning to learn how to code and design basic programs, it may be difficult to decide where to start
            due to the expansive amount of technology and languages that are being used today. This is where my website Learn2Code will hopefully help
            a multitude of people. The journey of learning and becoming profecient in these different languages will not be an easy one and will require 
            a large amount of dedication. It may seem like a lot but learning the basics and practicing continously will be the foundations of becoming 
            a master programmer. I hope my website can be used by many to learn, whether it be for a fun pasttime or practicing to become a software developer
            at a major company.  
        </p>
